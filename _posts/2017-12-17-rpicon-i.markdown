### Idea

I own a raspberry pi model B from one of the first generations which is quite hard to develop on because of how slow it is.

I end up writing all of the code on my regular computer and then uploading to the pi which can be cumbersome particularly for GPIO intensive projects.

The idea of RPiCon is to have an application to develop and test code locally (even with GPIO) and easily deploy.

You can find code code [on github][rpicon].

### Features

* Edit python code
* Run the code mocking the RPi GPIO lib
* The GPIO mock will connect to virtual pins embedded in the application to display the output and also allow manual input.
* Find a raspberry pi on the local network and deploy the code into it

### Technology Stack

[Preact] for a super small and component-based view

[Electron] to build it as a native application

[Photon] to easily get the feel of a mac application

The development was made easier by the [preact-photon] lib and the starter app [preact-photon-electron-quick-start].

### Current Status

Right now I have code editor that is able to run python code with the mock GPIO available.
